# Welcome to My Reactjs Calculator
***

## Task
The goal of this project is to create a simple yet effective calculator application using ReactJS. 
The calculator should be able to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and support multiple operations in sequence. Users should also be able to clear the input buffer and start new calculations easily.
## Description
The application is a single-page, single-route ReactJS application that provides the following features:

Perform basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, and /
Display the result of operations as they are calculated
Support multiple consecutive operations
Clear the input buffer with a dedicated "Clear" button
Responsive design with custom CSS styling
The project showcases the flexibility of ReactJS for building user interfaces, leveraging React components, props, and state to handle input and output dynamically.

## Installation
To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repo-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd my-reactjs-calculator
Install the necessary dependencies:
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:
sql
Copy code
npm start
This will launch the calculator app in your default browser at http://localhost:8080.

Usage
Once the application is running, you can use the calculator to perform simple arithmetic operations by clicking the buttons. The interface includes:

Number buttons (0-9)
Arithmetic operation buttons (+, -, *, /)
An "Equals" button (=) to evaluate the expression
A "Clear" button to reset the input
